"""
Tests for answer normalization (normalize_label function).

The normalize_label function extracts YES/NO from model responses using
an 8-step parsing cascade designed to handle:
- Standard FINAL_ANSWER: markers
- Chain-of-thought outputs without explicit markers
- Revision patterns ("yes... actually no")
- Unparseable responses

These tests ensure robustness across diverse model output formats.
